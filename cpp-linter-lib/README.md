# cpp-linter-lib

This crate contains the the library used as a backend for the
`cpp-linter` binary executable.

Since the [cpp-linter python package][pypi-org] now uses this library
as a binding, the native binary's `main()` method is also present in this
library.

See also the [CLI document hosted on github][gh-pages].
